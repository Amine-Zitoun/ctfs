# ctf_writeups
this is where you find my solutions for challenges I solved for some capture the flag competetions I participated in 

# GAMMER
the idea for this challenge was to brute force the flag charachter by charachter by checking with the output of the chall 


# PINCODE
the idea for this challnge was also to brute force the 4 digit pin code and then you will get the flag

# 2048
In this challnge we got a zip file with a msg inside of it encoded in base64
and when decoding it you also get another base64 encoded string
so I coded a recursive function that would decode the base 64 encoded strings unti we get can't anymore and by that getting the flag

# Hot Access
In this web category challenge what we have to do is "Access" some files from the server through file traversal

# MASK 
in this web category challenge there was a basic SSTI vuln to exploit
